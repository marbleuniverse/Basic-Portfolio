        <p> 
            My name is Noah Burke, I am a 19 year old living in Philadelphia. I am very interested in music, writing, and computers. 
            I am vert interested in the intersection of technology and design, especially their effects on the dissemeniation of knowledge
            that was previously impossible to organize and quantify.
